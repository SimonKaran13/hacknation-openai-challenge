## MVP UI Concept

### Header
- Command Bar: “Query Organizational Memory…”
- System Status Badge: e.g. `98% Aligned`

### Left Sidebar — Deconfliction Console
- List of detected conflicts (e.g. mismatched launch dates)
- Short explanation + Resolve action
- Conflicts turn green once resolved

### Center — Living Knowledge Graph
- Interactive graph visualization
- Nodes: Teams, Decisions, Stakeholders
- Edges:
  - Green = aligned
  - Red = blocked or conflicting
- Clicking a node opens a Context Card with:
  - Latest decisions
  - Owners
  - Dependencies

### Right Sidebar (Top) — Agent Activity Log
- Transparent view into AI actions
- Examples:
  - “Routed Q3 report to Sarah (Project Lead)”
  - “Detected duplicate roadmap decisions”

### Right Sidebar (Bottom) — Organizational Version Control
- Timeline of changes to organizational truth
- Versioned and attributed updates

## Superhuman Element
An agentic AI that:
- Observes all communication
- Understands dependencies
- Resolves conflicts
- Prevents overload
- Preserves memory

Acts like a Chief of Staff, not a chatbot.

## Example Demo Flow
1. Meeting ends → knowledge graph updated
2. Conflict detected → shown in Deconfliction Console
3. “What changed today?” → visual diff in graph
4. New joiner → instant context view

## Why It Matters
Visibility unlocks alignment.
Alignment unlocks speed.

This is a step toward superhuman organizational coordination.
