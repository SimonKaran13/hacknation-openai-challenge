# Build the Superhuman AI Chief of Staff
*Sponsored Track by OpenAI*

## The Moonshot

Search engines organize the world’s information.  
Social media learned how to amplify information at global scale.

But inside organizations, information still spreads blindly.

Meetings, messages, emails, voice notes, and documents flow without intelligence.  
Some people are overwhelmed.  
Others are left out.  
There is no true source of truth.  
No map of how knowledge moves inside a company.  
No transparency into who knows what and why.

The next frontier of AI is not answering questions.  
It is organizing information for collective problem-solving.

**The challenge:**  
Can we make information inside a company **100× more targeted, transparent, and actionable**?

## The Vision

Build an **AI Operating System for Organizational Communication** —  
a **Superhuman AI Chief of Staff** that becomes the brain of a company.

An agentic AI system that:

- Maps how information flows across teams  
- Builds a stakeholder map and a company knowledge graph  
- Creates a living source of truth  
- Decides what to amplify, restrict, and route  
- Maintains versioned organizational memory  
- Works across text, voice, and visual interfaces  

Not a chatbot.  
Not a feed.  
A new intelligence layer for how organizations think and coordinate.

## The Core Idea

Think of this as:

- “Organizing the world’s information” — for a single organization  
- “Social media for knowledge” — but strategic, not viral  
- “Version control” — for organizational truth  

Your system should answer:

- Who needs to know this?  
- What is the current truth?  
- What just changed?  
- Where is knowledge blocked or duplicated?  

The goal is not more communication.  
It is **better communication**.

---

## The Superhuman Element

At the center is an agentic AI that:

- Sees all communication  
- Understands dependencies  
- Resolves conflicts  
- Creates transparency  
- Never overwhelms humans  

This AI is the company’s superpower:
its memory,  
its filter,  
its coordinator,  
its Chief of Staff.

A **Superhuman AI Co‑Founder** for communication and alignment.

## The Challenge

Design a system that can:

- Map information flow inside an organization  
- Build a stakeholder and knowledge graph  
- Create a living source of truth  
- Version and update knowledge continuously  
- Orchestrate communication across teams  
- Visualize how understanding spreads  
- Work across modalities (voice, text, mobile, visual)  

This is not about features.  
It is about inventing a new abstraction:

**Organizational Intelligence**

## Example Scenarios

- A meeting ends → the AI updates the shared knowledge graph and notifies relevant stakeholders  
- A decision is made → the AI version-stamps it and routes it to affected teams  
- A founder asks “What changed today?” → the AI generates a visual map of updates  
- A new stakeholder joins → the AI creates an instant context view  
- The AI detects conflicting information → a critic agent flags it for review

## Hints & Resources

### Sample Datasets (Proxies for Company Communication)

- **Enron Email Dataset**  
  Public corporate email corpus with sender, receiver, timestamps, and message content  
  Useful for building communication graphs and stakeholder maps

- **SNAP Email Network Datasets (Stanford)**  
  Useful for graph modeling and information flow analysis

- **Public mailing lists or forums**  
  Threads, participants, and timestamps as proxies for team communication

### What to Extract from Data

- People and teams  
- Topics and decisions  
- Communication frequency  
- Dependencies  
- Knowledge clusters  

### Technical Directions (Optional)

- Knowledge graphs (Neo4j, NetworkX, graph databases)  
- LLMs for summarization and entity extraction  
- Voice input and speech-to-text  
- Visual dashboards for communication flow  
- Multi-agent systems (memory agent, critic agent, coordinator agent)

## Evaluation Criteria

Projects are evaluated primarily on **vision and interaction quality**, not feature count.

| Criterion | What We Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Communication Intelligence | How well the system models and routes information |
| Knowledge Graph & Stakeholder Map | Clear representation of structure and dependencies |
| UI & Visualization | Strong visual models of communication and AI reasoning |
| UX & Interaction | Voice and low-friction interaction |
| Creativity & Moonshot Thinking | Bold interpretation of AI as a company brain |
| Deconfliction & Critique | Detecting contradictions or overload |
| Demo Quality | Clear, compelling, intuitive prototype |

Special emphasis is placed on **visualizing agentic AI reasoning and communication flows**.

## Why It Matters

If this works, we unlock superhuman capacity in organizations.

Innovation accelerates.  
Factories coordinate better.  
Medical needs are delivered faster.  
Decisions become visible and trustworthy.

Today, most organizations have no transparency into:

- How knowledge is distributed  
- How decisions propagate  
- Where communication breaks down  

By creating transparency, we unlock alignment.  
By unlocking alignment, we unlock speed.

## The Outcome

An **AI Chief of Staff**.  
A **company brain**.  
A **Superhuman AI Co‑Founder**.

A new way for humans and AI to solve problems together.
