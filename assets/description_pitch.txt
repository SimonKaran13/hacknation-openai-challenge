HackNation OpenAI Challenge presents a prototype AI Chief of Staff that turns fragmented internal communication into a structured, living source of truth.
Modern teams make critical decisions across emails, chats, and meetings, but the resulting context is often lost, duplicated, or miscommunicated. Important actions fall through the cracks, stakeholders are left uninformed, and organizational knowledge becomes impossible to track. Our project addresses this problem by centralizing communication, tasks, and decisions into a single, actionable system.
At the core is a backend API and database that store employees, tasks, and communication events in a structured, queryable form. A web-based client UI consumes this API to provide a dashboard that visualizes tasks, communication flows, and organizational state in real time. Complementing this is an external, cloud-deployed intelligent agent that acts as a bridge between real-world communication channels—such as email, chat platforms, and meeting notes—and the system itself.
The agent ingests unstructured messages, detects decisions and updates, logs them in the database, and automatically notifies the relevant stakeholders. This ensures that decisions are transparent, changes are traceable, and information reaches the right people without manual coordination.
In addition, the project includes a standalone onboarding proof of concept that demonstrates how a new company could be bootstrapped using historical email data. By processing raw email communication, the system can infer employees, teams, tasks, and communication structures, enabling rapid onboarding at scale.
Together, these components showcase how an AI-driven platform can streamline internal operations, reduce information loss, and transform everyday communication into a continuously updated organizational memory.
